Genome Assembly with Flye
This repository contains scripts and instructions for performing genome assembly using Flye, a de novo assembler for long noisy reads (such as Nanopore and PacBio).

Requirements
Flye (version 2.9+ recommended)
Bash (for running the supplied scripts)
Sufficient computational resources (adjust --threads as needed)
Input Data
Raw or corrected long reads in FASTQ format (Nanopore or PacBio)
Place your input .fastq files in a designated input directory (see Usage)
Scripts
Batch Assembly Script
The run_flye_batch.sh script automates assembly for all FASTQ files in an input directory and writes each assembly result to a separate folder in the output directory.

Usage
bash
./run_flye_batch.sh /path/to/input_folder /path/to/output_folder
/path/to/input_folder: Directory containing .fastq files to assemble.
/path/to/output_folder: Directory where each assembly result will be saved.
Example
bash
./run_flye_batch.sh ./input_fastqs ./assemblies
Each FASTQ file will be assembled separately, and results will be stored in subdirectories within ./assemblies.

Script Details
The script loops over all .fastq files in the input folder.
For each file, it runs Flye and outputs results to a uniquely named output subfolder.
You can modify Flye parameters (e.g., --nano-raw, --nano-corr, --threads) as needed.
Output
Each sample will have a separate output directory containing:

assembly.fasta: The assembled contigs.
flye.log: Assembly log.
Other intermediate files generated by Flye.
Customization
By default, the script uses the --nano-raw flag for Nanopore raw reads. If you have corrected reads or PacBio data, adjust the script accordingly.
Set the number of threads with the --threads parameter.
